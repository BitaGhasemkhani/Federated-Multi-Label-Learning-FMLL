Noisy data is a prevalent issue in data mining, significantly impacting the performance of classification algorithms. Mathematical methods are crucial in tackling this obstacle, particularly in optimizing noise detection and data preprocessing. This study proposes a novel approach—Joint Tomek Links (JTL)— to identify and eliminate noisy instances by detecting pairs of nearest neighbors from different classes. It first finds the Tomek links and then refines a probabilistic method to determine which instance from a pair will be removed.
